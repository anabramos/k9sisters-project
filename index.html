            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p> 
                We are Ana & Helena and we have love dogs since we were children. 
                We would always dream of being veterinarians, biologists and dog trainers. 
                In 2015 we started the K9 sisters - a company dedicated to giving your dog and you (dog owner) the best care while you are away, being that during the day, the night or the weekend. 
                We are certified dog trainers and groomers and our mission is to create a space that is fun and safe for your dog, and keep you relaxed while you are away.
