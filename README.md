## About K9 Sisters
K9 Sisters is a website for dog sitting services in Amsterdam-West. It is my first project as part of the Diploma in Software Development at Code Institut.

The K9 Sisters project is a user centric (static) Front-End Development website for dog sitting services in Amsterdam-West and sorroundings. It is targeted at dog owners who live and/or work in Amsterdam-West and who make use of dog sitting services regularly or esporadically.
