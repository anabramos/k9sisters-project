# K9 Sisters

## About K9 Sisters
K9 Sisters is a website for dog sitting services in Amsterdam-West. It is my first project as part of the Diploma in Software Development at Code Institut.

The K9 Sisters project is a user centric (static) Front-End Development website for dog sitting services in Amsterdam-West and sorroundings. It is targeted at dog owners who live and/or work in Amsterdam-West and who make use of dog sitting services regularly or esporadically. 

### Comment to myself: add link to deployed website
### Comment to myself: add mockup images

The user experience for the website is build with 3 personas in mind. Each persona presents a different user story and has goals when accessing the website. 

### Personas

- Persona 3: Potential costumer (first time visitor)
