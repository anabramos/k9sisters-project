                <h2><span class="text-orange">GROOMING:</span>The best guide on how to clip your dog's nails</h2>
                <p> In today’s ‘grooming during lockdown’ post series we tackle one of the most difficult grooming tasks, that will give any dog or dog owner some anxiety. That is: Trimming your dogs nails. Now during the pandemic the grooming of dogs (and humans) who depend on monthly care has been affected and people are having to take on the tasks of grooming themselves and their dogs at home. </p> 
                <p>Although this tasks can be feared by most dog owners, we are here to help you out, because trimming a dog’s nail can be really easy if done right. Check our tips and tricks on how to do it in the comfort of your home.</p>
                <p>Please note we advise all dog owners who do not feel comfortable doing this alone to seek professional help. It can be specially tricky to trim nails from a dog who is not used to being touched in their paws. We reccomend dog owners to be affectionate with their dogs paws and play with it since its early ages so that this process can be made easier in the future.</p>       
                <p>
                    <strong><i class="fas fa-bone"></i> Peanut butter</strong><br />
                    To make this process easier we reccomend using a spoon with peanut butter. This will make your dog enjoy the process and distract him from the work you are performing on his nails.

                <p>
                    <strong><i class="fas fa-bone"></i> Get your dog used to it first</strong><br />
                    A dog needs to be comfortable first before you can take on this task on yourself. Prior to the trimming day, we recommend showing your dog the nail clipper and letting the dog smellt it, touch their paws with it, always giving him a praise for a good job or even a treat. This will make your dog familiar with the instrument that will be used for the nail trimming procedure.

                    <strong><i class="fas fa-bone"></i> Use an appropriate and safe tool</strong><br />
                    There are so many varieties of dor nail clippers that it can be overwhealming to chose one. You can always contact your regular vet/groomer to get their opinion on which one is the best for you and your dog. Also, If you dont know how to use one and this will be your first time trimming your dog's nails, please do contact your vet/groomer for their istructions on how to handle these tools.

                    <strong><i class="fas fa-bone"></i> Firm but gentle touch</strong><br />
                    When holding your dog's paw for the trim, make sure to hold it firmly making sure he wont be able to move considerably, but also be gentle so it wont stress the dog. When holding the pay you must push you thumb towards the paw to extend the nail completely.    
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong><i class="fas fa-bone"></i> Begin slowly and short</strong><br />
                    When finally clipping the nails, you want to do this slowly and just small bits by bits to make sure you dont cut too much into the nail and risk reaching the quick (which will cause bleedding). A rule of thumb here is to clip the tip of the nail only and never cut into the curve of the nail. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    We hope you have anjoyed our nail clipping tips. And dont forget: When in doubt always contact a professional!
