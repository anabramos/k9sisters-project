                <h3>TRAINING: 3 simple commands to teach your dog during the lockdown. </h3>
                <p> When you think of training a dog, think or a marathon and not a sprint! Even in our own training school we always say: we teach you the tools you need to train your dog, but we need you to apply these every day to see the results in the future. How fast the training can take depends on how often do you practice and your dog’s predisposition to learn new things. For example, while puppies take more work to train, they learn faster because they are not used to old manners. Older dogs for example can take less work (because they have less energy) but will take longer since they already know life a certain way. Feeling overwhelmed on where to start? What about with these simple 3 commands?</p>

                    <p>While some people took on baking as their newest pandemic hobbies, we from the K9 Sisters have taken on baking dog treats that are also edible for humans.

In the last year we have tried almost 20 recipes of dog treats, ranging from peanut butter to carrots, but this one is our ultimate favorite. Dont miss the chance and check our this latest post on how to make this 4 ingredient only homemade vegan dog treat with pumpkin and peanut butter.</p>
